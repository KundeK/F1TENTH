# F1TENTH
This repository contains implementations of key modules for developing and testing autonomous racing capabilities using ROS2. Below is the checklist of completed and in-progress modules:

## Features Checklist
- [x] **Introduction to ROS2**  
  Learn the basics of ROS2 to build and integrate robotic systems for autonomous racing.

- [x] **Automatic Emergency Braking**  
  Implement safety mechanisms to detect obstacles and automatically stop the vehicle in critical situations.

- [ ] **Wall Following**  
  Develop algorithms to follow walls precisely, maintaining optimal distance for lap-time efficiency.

- [ ] **Follow the Gap**  
  Utilize the Follow-the-Gap method for obstacle avoidance and efficient pathfinding in cluttered environments.

- [ ] **SLAM and Pure Pursuit**  
  Integrate SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for environment mapping and Pure Pursuit for trajectory tracking.

- [ ] **Motion Planning**  
  Implement motion planning algorithms for efficient and collision-free path execution.

- [ ] **Perception & Vision**  
  Employ computer vision techniques for object detection, lane recognition, and situational awareness.

- [ ] **Perception and Planning**  
  Combine perception and planning modules for robust decision-making in complex environments.
